<h3 id="orgbbd7c9a">Theory &amp; Methodology</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbbd7c9a">
<p>
I'm deeply interested in theory and methodology; how explanations can be formed and evaluated when seeking to explain a system as complex as the economy. Especially in macroeconomics, I hope to explore questions relating to the efficacy of DSGE models and what amendments or alternatives might improve our understanding of the macroeconomy. 
</p>

<p>
Criticism of DSGE models has been palpable, two examples from Nobel-laureates are Stiglitz's <i>Where Modern Macroeconomics Went Wrong</i> [cite:@stiglitz2017] and Akerlof's <i>What They Were Thinking Then: The Consequences for Macroeconomics during the Past 60 Years</i> [cite:@akerlof2019]. On the other side, Christiano's <i>On DSGE Models</i> [cite:@christiano2018] provides context and responds to criticisms from Stiglitz mentoined above. A paper examining the way DSGE models are calibrated and their efficacy assessed is Korinek's <i>Thoughts on DSGE Macroeconomics: Matching the Moment, But Missing the Point?</i> [cite:@korinek2017]. Relatedly–Gali's <i>The State of New Keynesian Economics: A Partial Assessment</i> [cite:@gali2018]. Glandon's <i>Macroeconomic Research, Present and Past</i> [cite:@glandon2023] provides a recent (2023) survey of the macroeconomics landscape in a historical context. Of course, many questions on this front overlap with microeconomics and rational expectations assumptions–in <i>The Formation of Expectations, Inflation, and the Phillips Curve</i> [cite:@coibion2018] Coibion argues that surveyed empirical micro-evidence appears increasingly at odds with the full-information rational expectation assumption. 
</p>

<p>
Foundational work in the nature of causation and inference in econometrics fascinates me. Recently Markus summarized much of the discussion on this front to date in <i>Causal effects and counterfactual conditionals: contrasting Rubin, Lewis and Pearl.</i> [cite:@markus2021]. Enduring, influential critiques in methodology, such as the Lucas critique [cite:@lucasjr1976] are inspiring work for me. A recent paper examining the neutrality of money in light of the Lucas critique is Clerc's <i>Dispersed information and the non-neutrality of money: fifty years after Lucas</i> [cite:@clerc2022]. Heckman tackles the causality question in a policy context in <i>The Econometric Model for Causal Policy Analysis</i> [cite:@heckman2022].

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org399f4cc">
<p>
Time-series econometrics and stochastic processes are my main areas of interest in econometrics; especially applications in macroeconomics.
</p>

<p>
I also am interested to explore new types of methodologies for statistical inference such as Bayesian methods like Koop's <i>Bayesian Multivariate Time Series Methods for Empirical Macroeconomics</i> [cite:@koop2009], or that of Ho [cite:@ho2023]. Cascaldi-Garcia in <i>What is Certain about Uncertainty?</i> [cite:@cascaldi-garcia2023] contrasts the various existing measures of uncertainty, risk, and volatility, noting their conceptual distinctions. Ludvigson's <i>Uncertainty and Business Cycles: Exogenous Impulse or Endogenous Response</i> also addresses this delicate question about uncertainty in models of business cycles.
</p>

<p>
I'm keen to study time-varying parameter models, such as in Leiva-Le\'on's <i>Endogenous Time Variation in Vector Autoregressions</i> [cite:@leiva-leon2023]. Kim covers the issue of endogeneity in models with dynamic parameters in <i>Dealing with Endogeneity in Regression Models with Dynamic Coefficients</i> [cite:@kim2009]. This extends to models of time-varying stochastic parameters, too, like Cross's <i>Large stochastic volatility in mean VARs</i> [cite:@cross2023], or in Bolko [cite:@bolko2023], Arias [cite:@arias2023], or Chan [cite:@chan2023].
</p>

<p>
I'd like to examine models outside of standard parameterized linear models, such as regime switching models [cite:@kole2023] [cite:@hauzenberger2021], econometric tests for structural change [cite:@fu2023]; approaches modeling nonlinear relationships [cite:@cui2023] [cite:@reif2021],  or that model nonstationary processes [cite:@casini2023] [cite:@blasques2023]. More broadly, I'd like to explore nonparametric techniques in macroeconometrics [cite:@racine2007].
</p>

<p>
Machine learning techniques increasingly show promise in econometrics, either for forecasting in econometrics [cite:@gouletcoulombe2022] [cite:@wang2023], solving dynamic economic models [cite:@maliar2021], or modeling economic phenomena outright such as market equilibration [cite:@he2023].

My interests in macro mostly focus on integrated approaches to understanding the real, financial, and monetary systems and their relationship with one another. Especially in the context of business cycle research and in light of modern monetary and fiscal policy interventions and mechanisms. Studying credit expansion/contraction processes and dynamics in the banking sector interest me, too.

<p>
My interests here are closely related to broader macro, yet look 'under the hood' a bit more than traditional macro, for example studying banking sector structure, household credit dynamics, and specific financial asset class price dynamics. I particularly want to study dynamic models that incorporate novel policy channels like quantitative easing asset purchase programs that modern central banks employ. Also, examining models with heterogeneity in the agent's balance sheet composition hopefully can shed light on pressing issues like inequality of wealth and income distribution, credit rationing, and other nuanced factors that may affect growth and business cycles.

When I worked in asset management, I realized how much money was invested by institutions according to mandates and strucured, rules-based approaches. This leads to the possibility of emergent synchronization and comovement in some of the largest pools of capital in the world if the strategies for rules-based investing resemble one another. An example of research in this direction is Buffa [cite:@buffa2023]. Lochstoer [cite:@lochstoer2022] examines the imperfect and time-delayed reactions of many market participants, providing insight on stylized facts otherwise difficult to reconcile like a weak or even negative risk‐return trade‐offs.
</p>

<p>
Swanson [cite:@swanson2021] measured the effects of federal reserve forward guidance and asset purchases on financial markets. Pflueger [cite:@pflueger2022] also explores the increasingly important impact the Fed and other central banks can have on financial markets and the behavior of agents and economic sectors. A different perspective on developments leading to the GFC is given by Alban [cite:@albanesi2022], wherein the rise in mortgage defaults were concentrated among prime borrowers, and that life cycle effects and mortgage investor activity are primary factors behind the evolution of debt and default in this period.
</p>

<p>
The dyanmics of sovereign debt accumulation, and current and historical crises, especially on the household and firm sector interests me. Mitchener [cite:@mitchener2023] provides timely analysis of the incresing sovereign debt levels, potential rollover problems, concerns about sustainability, and historical mechanisms for propogation of sovereign debt risks to households and firms. Feldhutter [cite:@feldhutter2023] highlights the importance of treating debt stochsatically and the improvement of credit spread models by doing so. Debt sustainability, especially in a low interest rate world is examined by Mehrotra [cite:@mehrotra2021].

<p>
I've always been puzzled by the treatment of 'capital' in many economic models. No doubt others have been too (for instance in the Cambridge Capital Controversies [cite:@burmeister2000]). Especially in today's technological and software-laden economy, the distinction between intangible and tangible capital is more pressing than ever. Many conversations in my portfolio consulting job centered around how to treat intangibles on the balance sheet of firms during valuation of the company. Exploring intangible capital, especially given the rise of capitalized R&amp;D, software focused firms and even artificial intelligenceand, and its relation to economic growth and production theory is of high interest to me. Corrado [cite:@corrado2022] provides a great overview on the problem and relates it to modern discussions and accounting conventions in growth theory. Additionally, intangible vs. tangible capital structures may impact efficacy of some policy transmission channels. For instance Dottling [cite:@dottling2023] found that investment and stock prices of firms with relatively more intangible assets respond less to monetary policy.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5712416">
<p>
Underlying structures in monetary and political institutions seems deeply related to the macroeconomic dynamics that emerges over time. I hope to study this historically (e.g., monetary regimes in U.S. history like the Gold Standard, Bretton Woods system, Petrodollar system, etc.), econometrically and theoretically.
</p>

<p>
Cogley in <i>Structural breaks in an endogenous growth model [Monetary policy regimes and beliefs]</i> [cite:@cogley2022] studied the effects of parameter uncertainty prompted by structural breaks, finding that agents in their model respond differently to uncertainty prompted by regime shifts in shock processes than they react to comparable perceived increases in shock volatility.

Models accounting for the complexity in macroeconomic dynamics interest me. As Barnett points out in <i>Bifurcation of Macroeconometric Models and Robustness of Dynamical Inferences</i> [cite:@barnett2015] "While existence of bifurcation boundaries is well known in economic theory, econometricians using macroeconometric models rarely take bifurcation into consideration, when producing policy simulations from macroeconometrics models. Such models are routinely simulated only at the point estimates of the models' parameters."
</p>

<p>
There are many heterodox approaches to "complexity" in economics, but I think Hommes' <i>Behavioral and Experimental Macroeconomics and Policy Analysis: A Complex Systems Approach</i> [cite:@hommes2021] provides a nice summary of why this perspective is worth paying attention to in theory and policy. Generally, Hommes' work (<a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/h/o/c.h.hommes/c.h.hommes.html?cb#Profile">URL</a>) provides an examples of complex systems inspired approaches, especially emphasizing the role of expectations, belief formation and feedback mechanisms in real, financial and monetary variables as well as bifurcations and changes in system stability.
